14.	Verify Ethernet Cable Connection
Issue: Ethernet connection is not detected.
Ethernet cables can have physical faults that disrupt connectivity. Checking the status with a tool like ethtool verifies cable integrity and connection status, helping identify hardware problems.
Solution: Check the status of the Ethernet cable and connection interface.
Command: sudo ethtool <interface_name>

15.	Flush ARP Cache
Issue: I have connectivity issues with a specific device on the network.
The ARP cache stores IP-to-MAC address mappings. Clearing it helps resolve issues related to outdated or conflicting address mappings, which can block access to certain devices.
Solution: Clear the ARP cache to resolve IP conflicts.
Command: sudo ip -s -s neigh flush all

16.	Check for Duplicate IP Addresses
Issue: I suspect there is an IP conflict on the network.
Duplicate IPs cause conflicts, preventing devices from connecting properly. Checking for duplicates helps identify conflicts, allowing you to reconfigure addresses to prevent connectivity issues.
Solution: Check for duplicate IP addresses in the network.
Command: sudo arping -D -I <interface> <IP_address>

17.	Restart a Specific Network Interface
Issue: One of my network interfaces isn't responding.
If a specific interface is unresponsive, restarting it reinitializes its configuration, often resolving issues related to temporary malfunctions or IP assignment errors.
Solution: Restart the specific network interface.
Command: sudo ifdown <interface_name> && sudo ifup <interface_name>

18.	Diagnose DHCP Issues
Issue: I am not getting an IP address from the DHCP server.
DHCP assigns IP addresses to devices. Restarting the DHCP client can help re-establish communication with the DHCP server, ensuring a correct IP configuration if the client failed initially.
Solution: Restart the DHCP client.
Command: sudo dhclient -v <interface_name>

19.	Traceroute to Identify Network Hops and Delays
Issue: I want to locate where delays are occurring in the network.
Traceroute tracks the path of packets to a destination. It reveals points of delay, which can help diagnose slow or unstable connections by pinpointing network congestion or ISP issues.
Solution: Use traceroute to find network latency points.
Command: traceroute <destination_IP_or_URL>

20.	List All Network Connections
Issue: I need to see a list of all current network connections and their states.
Listing connections shows active connections and their states, helping diagnose potential unauthorized connections or understand what’s using the network.
Solution: Use ss to list socket statistics.
Command: ss -tunap

21.	Diagnose DNS Resolution Issues
Issue: DNS resolution is slow or failing.
DNS resolution issues are common in slow-loading sites. Testing with an alternative DNS server helps determine if the issue is with the default DNS server or another part of the connection.
Solution: Test with an alternate DNS server to verify if the issue is with the DNS.
Command: dig google.com @8.8.8.8

22.	Reset Network Settings
Issue: Network settings might be corrupted.
Network settings can become corrupted due to misconfigurations or software updates. Resetting them to defaults helps clear errors and reverts configurations to a known working state.
Solution: Reset network configurations to default.
Command: sudo systemctl restart networking

23.	Check Wireless Signal Strength
Issue:  My Wi-Fi signal is weak.
Weak Wi-Fi signals often cause slow speeds or disconnects. Checking signal strength can help determine if the issue is due to interference, distance from the router, or physical obstructions.
Solution:  Check Wi-Fi signal strength to troubleshoot signal issues.
Command: iwconfig <interface_name> 

24.	View Routing Table
Issue: I need to verify if routing rules are correctly configured.
Routing tables determine how packets are directed on a network. Checking them helps verify if routes to destinations are correctly configured, which is crucial for network access.
Solution: Display the routing table.
Command: route -n

25.	Test with Alternate Network Interface
Issue: Wireless connection is unstable, I want to test with Ethernet.
Switching interfaces (e.g., from Wi-Fi to Ethernet) can help isolate issues. If Ethernet works but Wi-Fi doesn’t, it indicates a Wi-Fi-specific issue like signal interference or misconfiguration.
Solution: Temporarily disable the Wi-Fi interface and enable Ethernet.
Command:  sudo ifconfig <wifi_interface_name> down && sudo ifconfig <ethernet_interface_name> up
